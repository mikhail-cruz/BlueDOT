					</p>

					<h2 class="mt-5">OUR VISION FOR CHANGE</h2>
					<p>
						Our world needs transformational change. It's time for the world to hold sectors accountable for their role in our environmental crisis while also calling for bold, creative, and innovative solutions. This will require action at all levels, from business and investment to
						city and national government. That's where you come in: As an individual, you yield real power and influence as a consumer, a voter, and a member of a community that can unite for change. Don't underestimate your power. When your voice and your actions are united with
						thousands or millions of others around the world, we create a movement that is inclusive, impactful, and impossible to ignore. Every Earth Day can drive a year of energy, enthusiasm, and commitment to create a new plan of action for our planet. '
